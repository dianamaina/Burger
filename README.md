# Burger logger.

In this project, I have created a burger logger with mysql, node, express and handlebars.


## User Story

```
AS A foodie
I WANT to search for burgers in this particular restaurant.
SO THAT I can save all my Devour experiences.
```

## EAT-DA-BURGER

```
GIVEN I insert the name of the burger
WHEN I click the button a picture of the burger shows up
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts to store the burger


the following app was a challenge to develop.
